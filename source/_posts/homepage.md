# About

I am a second-year Ph.D. student working with [Ming Li](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=oGgPXFEAAAAJ&hl=en) at University of Waterloo . 

The focus of my research lies on language modeling and text representation learning. 

Before that, I worked on spoken language understanding for task-oriented dialogue system with Yu Zhou, [Jiajun Zhang](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/jjzhang.htm), and [Chengqing Zong](http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/cip/english/zong.htm) at University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
