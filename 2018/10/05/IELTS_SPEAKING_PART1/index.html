<p>I usually call my boyfriend and have a chat with him when I feel bored. Because he is very humor and we have many topics to talk about which will definitly eliminate the boredom.</p>
<p><strong>When you were young, what would you do if you left bored?</strong></p>
<p> Each time I felt bored, I would play some destop games with my friends. My favourate desktop game is werewolf which is a roles play game and involves analytical ability and presentation skill.</p>
<p><strong>What kinds of things are boring to you?</strong></p>
<p>Attending some weekly report meetings makes me feel very bored. You have to listen to other students’ work reports for several hours which may un-revelvant to you.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think young people are more likely to get bored?</strong></p>
<p>No, I don’t so. Young people are always enthusimastic to nearly everything they meet and less likely to get bored. For example, a very very young people, I mean a child, can play with a chari, a table or other simple object for a whole day without any boredom.</p>

<p><strong>Which city have you been to recently?</strong></p>
<p>The city I have been to recently is the Harbin, the captial city of Heilongjiang Province. It located in the north-east of China and is famous for its winter scenary. I visited this city for several days and I love it very much.</p>

<p><strong>What kind of cities do you like?</strong></p>
<p>I like cities like Seattle and Mountain View as there are many great companies there such as Micrisoft and Google. I always dream about working in these companies with great people. I think I can learn from them a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Which city do you want to go to?</strong></p>
<p>The city I want to go is Seattle. My mentor in the company I interned last year was a professor in Washington University and she told me that Seattle is much more different from Beijing and I want to visit it next year.</p>

<p><strong>Do you usually wear clothes in your favourite color?</strong></p>
<p>Of course. I believe no one would like to wear any clothes whose colors they don’t like. For me, I like white and some dark color, so I usually wear white T-shirts with blue jeans and white sneakers.</p>

<p><strong>Is it difficult to cook Chinese food for you?</strong></p>
<p>No. Absolutely not. I have to admit that Chinese food is more complicate than some foreign food for its complex recipe. But it is easy to learn because cooking Chinese food need less tools. I believe those tools are hard to learn.</p>

<p>Occasionally. Only on some special days like Chrismas, Chinese spring festival or my friends’ birthdays and so on. </p>
